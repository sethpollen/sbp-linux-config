Get more corpora from various authors, rappers, public figures, etc. Add code
for stemming and computing frequency lists. Add UI for generating mashups of
different corpora.

Perhaps use https://github.com/simplenlg/simplenlg to de-conjugate verbs and
de-pluralize nouns and adjectives. I think that's all the lexical processing I
want to do; I don't want full stemming.
