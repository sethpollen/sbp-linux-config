TODO: fix terminal font. I like the one I get in Cinnamon; try to get the same
in i3. I think I just want DejaVu Sans Mono everywhere.

TODO: look at terminator settings. There may be some interesting things around
copy-paste.

TODO: fix brightness settings on new laptop. xbacklight doesn't work (!)

TODO: why can't i launch kate or muon from dmenu_run?

TODO: duplicate nm-applet icons in systray shortly after startup

TODO: revamp katerc and kmixrc
Also consider moving away from K things (Okular, muon, kate, kmix, ark) to Cinnamon
equivalents

TODO: maybe it's time to use a real font for i3 (as advised by i3wm.org and used by dmenu)
