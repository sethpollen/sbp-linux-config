Make tmux more like i3:
  1) We currently underline workspaces which have seen a bell since they were
     last focused. Instead, we should color them orange, like i3 does.
  2) Don't use full terminal title for tmux status lines. If the prompt has an
     INFO string, use just that (no PWD or other decorations).

Improve tmuxa and tmuxls. We'd like a single command which takes action based
on the number of existing tmux sessions:
  If 0: Create a new session and attach to it.
  If 1: Attach to the existing session.
  Else: Display a menu of existing sessions, and allow selection of one to
        attach to (or allow cancellation).
