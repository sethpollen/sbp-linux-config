TODO: Clean up TODOs in my Go repositories. I think there is a bunch of dead
      code in there which should just be deleted. I don't need path compression.

TODO: Remove go unit tests which aren't hermetic.

TODO: Get a better Go build system. Perhaps I can use Bazel? Then maybe I can
      put the go source tree in the same git repo as my other config stuff.

TODO: Maybe I should just switch all the Go stuff to C++.

TODO: Enable remote viewing of which shells commands are currently executing.
      This is sort of a poor man's tmux-- I want to be able to remotely monitor
      execution of tasks in other shells, but I don't want to have to pipe
      everything through a clunky tmux. We should be able to use the local
      Redis instance to store information about each zsh instance (i.e. is
      there a command executing, and if so, what is it?). We can use zsh's
      preexec and precmd hooks to grab this data.
