# Script for handling i3 workspaces with custom, user-entered names. Uses:
#   i3-named-workspace focus     # Prompts user for workspace name and focuses
#                                # that workspace.
#   i3-named-workspace move      # Prompts user for workspace name and moves
#                                # current container to that workspace.

# Quiet aliases for commands we need.
i3_msg_quiet() {
  # Suppress stdout, which is pretty chatty.

# Begin by prompting the user for a workspace name. We can use dmenu (with no
# predefined options) as a lightweight GUI for receiving a small piece of text
# from the user.
