NOTE

Bulleted lines (starting with "*") indicate entries I plan to include in my
i3 config.

CONCEPTS

Workspaces are arranged in 3-D space. There is the X-Y space onto which outputs
are arranged, and then there is a Z dimension representing the stack of
workspaces on each output.

FOCUSING WINDOWS

* Cycle focus through windows of the current workspace. I usually only have a
  few windows per workspace, so a single binding should be good enough.

FOCUSING WORKSPACES

* Jump to workspace by number (1-10) or a fresh workspace.

* Cycle focus through workspaces of the current output.

MOVING WINDOWS

* Extract current window from its workspace and move it to a workspace (given by
  number) or a fresh workspace.

* Move current window up, down, left, or right within its workspace.

MOVING WORKSPACES

* Move workspace among outputs in the X-Y plane.

* Move workspace up or down along the Z axis.

RESIZING

I think this can mostly stay the way it is.

OBSERVATIONS

In every case where a workspace number may be supplied, I also want the option
to get a fresh, empty workspace. Using the numbers keys for workspaces 1-10
and the Escape key for a fresh workspace seems reasonable.
